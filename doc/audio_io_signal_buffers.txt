The audio input path for a line input starts with an inverting and non-inverting amplifier, which creates a differential signal.
Each half of the differential signal is filtered by a passive RC low-pass filter
(6dB per octave) with about a 10KHz 3dB point.
This differential pair is sent to the input of the audio CODEC (it has
differential inputs).
The op-amps are biased so that the signals swing around VCOMAD (see the PCM3168A datasheet), which is about 2.5V.

On the outputs, the differential signal from the audio CODEC's output is passed
to a diff amp to create the unbalanced line-level signal.

The input impedance of the line-level audio input path is ~13K and the output
impedance is ~300R.
